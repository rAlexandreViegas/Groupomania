Groupomania

This is the last project of Openclassrooms, creation of a company social network : Groupomania

I used Express JS for the backend and React JS for the frontend.
For my database I used SQL with MariaDB associated with PHPMyAdmin in a Docker-Compose.

This is my first project with React JS.
I can clearly improve this project with the use of useContext and useReducer to reduce the amount of data I send down.

To launch the project you have to go to the backend folder and do :

### `npm i` then `npm start`

Then you have to go to the frontend folder and do :

### `npm i react-scripts` then `npm start`
